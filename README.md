## Sensitivity Analysis of LEO Satellites to Space Weather Activities

- **Radiation Model**
  - Fits a Weibull/triangular distribution to SOHO/ACE/STEREO flux data to estimate SEE.
  - Uses differential LET to estimate timeseries dosimetry data.
  - Ignores geomagnetic rigidity and Earth's shadow effects.

**Network Analysis**

- Uses propagated satellite locations to estimate coverage and visibility across the US.
- Estimates network capacity degradation and outage from unexpected satellite failures.
- Cascades the losses into downstream economic impacts.

**Satellite Fleet**

- Estimates drag at different latitudes using MSIS.
- Estimates propellant usage for each satellite.
